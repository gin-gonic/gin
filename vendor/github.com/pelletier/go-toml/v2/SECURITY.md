## Reporting a Vulnerability

Email a vulnerability report to `security@pelletier.codes`. Make sure to include
as many details as possible to reproduce the vulnerability. This is a
side-project: I will try to get back to you as quickly as possible, time
permitting in my personal life. Providing a working patch helps very much!
